This is four major projects for Computer Architecture Course, Fudan University, 2022 Spring, including a simple single-cycle CPU, a multi-cycle CPU, a pipeline CPU and a music player with FPGA.

## About the project
The main task of the project is to design and improve a CPU with different architectures, including a simple single-cycle CPU, a multi-cycle CPU, a pipeline CPU, to understand the basic principles of CPU design and the architecture of the modern computer system. The project also includes a music player with FPGA, which is a combination of hardware and software design.

## About our solution
We have implemented a simple single-cycle CPU, a multi-cycle CPU, a pipeline CPU, and a music player with FPGA. 
- The single-cycle CPU is the simplest one, which executes each instruction in one cycle. 
- The multi-cycle CPU divides the instruction execution into several stages, including instruction fetch, instruction decode, execution, memory access, and write-back. 
- The pipeline CPU further improves the performance by executing multiple instructions simultaneously in different stages. 
- All the CPUs support basic instructions, including arithmetic, logic, memory access, and control instructions.
- All the CPUs have IO interfaces to communicate with the outside world.
- Test benches are provided to verify the correctness of the CPU design.
- Simulation and on-board tests are conducted to evaluate the performance and correctness of the CPU design.
- The music player with FPGA is a combination of hardware and software design, which can play music stored in the FPGA memory.
